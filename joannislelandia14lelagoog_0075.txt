Ροιιειιιοιι Leland's Antiqultiesos L‘ondon, and for wantos ι “
Learning most grievoully mangled the Work on Purpose to
make rt his own This Hint 1 have taken partly from the
benerit of your last Cbnversation, when you was pleas’d to
read ιο me what Leland hae said upon the same Subjeft, and
partly frona my own Refleuion upon the Qalilicationso os
Stow, who certainly was not capable of making such a Col-
ιεέιιοιι, and therefore I cannot but conclude that he must
· have been beholden to Lelanrl3 which Ι think is likewife·
confirmed from hence, that in his Survey of London he makes
very little mention os Leland‚ alrho' in his Annals he often
takes notice of him. l had formerly—a much greater Veneta·
¹ tion sor Stow, before you acquainttd me that Leland had
wrote the Antiquities of this City‚ (of which he was a Na
tive ,) under the Britains, Romane, Saxone, DanesandNor·
mant, and so down ιο the time himself liv’d ιιιι by which
. Work we might have seen what Discoveries he had made
from ancient Authors, (most of which are since lost,) and
might-likewise have had the Benefit of divers useful Remedia,
grounded upon his own Observations‚ on the ancient Build·
ings os the Romans in this famous orry, thch Remarkt
could not be exspedledsrom Mt. Stow, who was uineae.-
quainted with the Coyns and other Antiquities of the Ro.- ’
thane. The best Account we have stotn him ts that re·
lating to Monumentnl Inscript' tons in Charcham which bringa ' '
ιο my mind a Fol. Me. (l have seen) of those ru Christ-
.Church formerly the Gray-Fryers) within Newgate, which
were not inserted in the firll lmprellron of the Survey. Iga· ·
thet srorn the Hand, that this very Book was collefled by ⁴
Leland‚ and it happened therefore very luckily that the ln·
¹ fcr·iptions in it were afterwards added in the Edition set out
by How. ’Tis moreover matter of wonder to me that Stow
should omitt Stepney Parilh, that he should be so very barren
in describing Westminster, and‚' rn short, that he should
throughout his whole Worlr so rarely mention any Antiqui·
ties of the Romans. But all this' rs to be resolv' d rnto the
little slrill he had ιιι Affairs of this Nature. By your publish-
ing a Colledlron of Mr. Leland’ s Worlrs the learned will have
a larther Light than what rs already discovered.
After this Digrelsron, let us return ιο the City, where be·
sdes what I have mentioned above wasa Roman Temple
near the Still· Yard (a place not far dislant from the Carnp 1
first obferv'd) arid this rs taken notice os ιιι Norden's Mid· ,
dlefex, who from Gefhy of Monmonth observes that rt was
aRoman Temple, where they offered Sacrifice to their
pounrry Gods. And this appears too from the following Oc·
