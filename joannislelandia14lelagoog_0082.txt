their ancient Liberty. Whereupon they first set upon tlte
Garrisons of the Veteran Souldiers, defeated the Ninth Le·
gion, and put to the Sword many thousand Romans and
their Allociates that inhabitcd this City; after which they
set the City on Fire in several Places, before Suetonius Go-
vernour 01 the Province could-rally his scatter’d Troops.

Thus this glorious City was reduced to an Heap of Rub-
bilh, and continued a great while in a desolate Condicion, ,
tho’ many 01 the Buildings were at length repaired, and there
is no doubt but if the Romans had continued amongst us,
they would have restored it to it's former Beauty‚ Splendonr
and Magnificence. But when they deserted the tsse, the Sax-
ons came in, and ’tis very well known that they were not ,
famous for Architesiure. . Indeed when the Normans settled ¹
amongst us, Building with stone began to revive, and the
City thereupon was continually adorn'd by the Care not only
01 our Kings and Princes, but os other great and illustrious
Personages3 but then what they did sor it was sometimes
suddenly effaced and destroyed by Pire, which hath frequently
happened in this great City, partly by Accident and-partly
by Desrgn, especially when a furious Enemy hath appeared ἵ
a ainst it. · ’

’ Having thus sar endeavoured to givea succindi Account
01 London as it was in the time 01 the Romans, stom my
own Observation, (altho’ sar short 01 what we mai reason·
ably conclude had been done by Leland,)1 shall next take
notic'e os some ancient Culloms, which had their original
from tlte Romans, (asl take it.) Tho’ these Culloms are not
so much prastised now, as they were formerly in this City,
yet they are pretty common in remote Parts, and if acol-
leslion of all 01 them were drawn up and publilhed together,
Iam apt to think that it would beavery nsefulas wellasa
pleasant Undertnking‚ and conduce in a good measure to the
clearing 01 many Particulars in the Roman History. New
improvements might be made every day, particularly as new
Monuments are discovered, which very often give a greater
Light to these early times than any written Books now re·
maining. We had not ltnown os many of the ancient Exercises
had it not been for tlte Arnndelian Marbles and other Monu-
ments 01 that ltind. Neither had the Names 01 several of
those that carried the Prizes in them been transmitted to us
without tlte help os such uncontelied'Evidence5 just as tlte
