times the Potter's Name was stamp’d at the bottom. This
Kiln was near to the Temple where Diana was worshipped,
that the People might be surnished with all sorta os Vessels
they had occasion 101 11 the time when they made their Sa·
crifices There 111111 been 1 great Qantity of the Frag-
mentsdigged up at the West Endos St. Paula os which I
have had several. And on the South fideos the Church‚ not
only in former times, as we are informed by J. Stow, 101
late days since the Tire, at the first beginning to build aiut
Paul's Chureh, the're were found several Scalps 01 Orien, and
a large quantity 01 Βο111 Tuas, with divers Earrhen Vessels,
especially Paterae, that were 01 different Shapes. t ’

Upon this occasion I must note hythe way, that from the
Observations l haue mades gather that all the Vessels made ·
use 01 hy the Romans in their sacrifices were generally made
01 red Earth and were glazed. But those osa larger Size‚ 11
their Platters, which received the Blood osthe Bcasts slaiu in·
sacrifice, were made 011 courser E'arth, hut 1101 red. Most
01 their Urns also (according 1ο their several Forms and Sizes)
were maidens another different sort os Earth; tho’ some are
found made of Glass, which however are not common.
Others of the greatest Rank had them made 01 Porphiry
Stone, and some os Copper enamell‘d with divers Colonrs. ⁴

The next PlaceI shall talte notice 01, 11 the Chamber of
Diana, situated on the Eminence 01 St. Paul'p Whars within
a great Gate next Dosior's Commoris, where are many sair .
Tenements, which in the Leases made by the Dean and Chap!
ter, go by the Name or Title os camera Dianae, so denomh
nated 110111 1 spacious Building ‘which 111 the Time 01 Hen-
ry 11. stood where the Houses are now ereded.

ln this Camere, or arched and vaulted 8111111111, suls of
intricate Meandee, the same K. Henry (as he 'rs said to have

'done at Woodslock) kept that Jewel 01 his Heart, sair Rosa·
moad, by the Name 01 Diana, and ’tis srom thence that this .
Edisice was denominated, - ' ,

Α1 this time (as is noted by How, in his Continnation os
stow, p. 781.) some Ruins 01 11 are remaining, and many
evident Testimoniea 01 intricate turninga and windings‚ 11 ’
also aSubterraneous passage to Castle Baynard‚ which uo
doubt the King made use of privately to have access to his
brightest Diana, one os the most exquisite and most celebrated
Beauties that we find mentioned in any Hislory.

Here we are at a loss sor Leland‘s opinion, but we may
vsuppose it 10 be aRoman Building‚ being so near to the
Temple os Diana. ἱ · “
