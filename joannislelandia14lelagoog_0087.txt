Perhaps it might be the Mannor House belonging to the ’
Lord, or elle the House of Sir John Collet, Father os Dean
Collet, who lyes buried in Stepney charch, and whoseMo-

Henry Vll. brought in the Use oi Flintbuilding, ¹which .

Sit HenryWotton ays was not praiiiled by the Ancients, in ,
which however he appears to be much mistakcn from what
harh been obserred by Montfaucon in his Diadum Italicum.
It was in his Reign that we began to be more regular in* our
Buildings, and had the use of Brick from the Italians. This
was afterwards revir’d by Inigo Jones anno 1630, who
brought it into common use, as he did that of BellconyS. ⁸ '
One of his first Buildings was that of the Piazza in Convent
Garden. A Florentino was Archiredi to HenryVII. Hans ·
Holben to Henry VIII. The Bricklayers of that Age were '
carious Worltmen, as might have been seen by the Buildinga -
at Hammon-Coun, St. James's, 'Whitehall Nonium-Hodie,
ἃς. especially by the Chimneys, not to be matched by any
in Europe lor uvariety of ' Forma, differing very much from
one another in the Texture and curiou's WorkmanIhIp;
some of which are now standing atWhitehall and St. james’s. -
From whatl have already said it may be gathered that this
City before the Fire anno 1666. was chiefly built with Tim·
ber, exceptiug some few Houses here and there intermixed,
that were built with Bsiclt, but most of them ill contriv’d,
altho’ some of them os excellent Workmanlhip, especially
the Fronte. 1 might proceed to make other Remarks of the
same ltind3 but I shall close this part of my Nores with this
Hint, that the best Account which harh been given of the
ancient State of London in respeit to the Buildinga, Pave-
ments, arrd the narrowness ol the Streets and Lares, is that
written by SirWilliam Darenant in a Play or Mock·Dialogue
between a Frenchman aud an Englilhman about the Supe-
rIority of Paris and London, which was published about the
Yetr 1650. there being another sort of Building much prac-
tised at that time, especially in the Gur-parts os the City,
which was very slight, and therefore called Paper-Buildinga
which Name is still continued tosome in the latter-Temple.
And now (because that wasone Branch of our Discourse)
1 shall proceed to take notice what Vrews and Ground-Plots
of this City have been cut in Wood‚ and after that engrav'd
' on Copper, altho’ at first they were paInted on Board, of
which sort 1 sindone mentioned in a MS‘. Inventory of the
l Furniture of K. Henry VIII.
