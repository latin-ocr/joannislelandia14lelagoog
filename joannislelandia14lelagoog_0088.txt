Mr. Btcroan’s Lnrrntt 1111111111ι

Coasting Part of England in a small portable Volume bound
and printed on velam, 01 rather Parclrment, by Winken de
Word An. 1520. This is the first I have seen of that kind,

“ altho' before 1111011111111011111001111118-011111111010 made
· by hand for the Benefit 01 Pilots. ,

[cannot make any thing 01 Leland' s Sketch 01 London,
(101 suchI take tt to be ‚) but 1 do not at all doubt but he rn-
tended a farther Draught, and put this down only by way
01 Memorandnm, 10 be improv'd by him as he had leisure3
and ’tis very likely that there was a much more considerable
and more accurate one in his Antiquities 01 London, that 1
before 1 poke 01.

Whether that View 01 London in lix Sheets cut in Wood
(which by the Spelling seems to have been done in Holland,
and 01 which 1011 1 have seen three) be the first finilhed

. Draught, [cannot as yet determinent thtslam sure 01

that the Atms of King James have been placed therein since
QMQQ

There ts another Dranglrt of London, different 110111 the
former, 01 one Sheet, cut also in Wood.

The next that hath come to my Knowledge is one of a ι
Sheet engraven on Copper, which seems to me to be the best,

·· and perhaps the most ancient. This taltes in only London,

and the Liberties 01 the same, that is, from Temple-Bar to
St. Katherine's, and the Bank Side in Southwark. More 01
the old Part 01 London is seen by this than by any other, and
111 my opinion it comes nearest to that Description 01 London,
intended by our Judicious Antiquary Mr. John Leland 01’ any
that are extant and 11 may be lew have seen more 0111111 1
nature than my self. l
The next Draught forits Antiquity 1 111111 take notice 01 ts
that publilhed m the Cities of the Wor’ld m three Volumes 1

ι by George Braun and Francis Hogenbergius anno 157 3 In 1

this Draught the City 01 London rs represented m one Sheet, 1
which takes rn the Cityof Westminster with the Tower to the l
Slaughter· ·,House and has the Arms 0111 Qeen Ellzabeth, and
the City 01 London By this you may perceive the Naked·
ness 01 the Buildings on the Btnk Side, as allo ιιι the Out· l
