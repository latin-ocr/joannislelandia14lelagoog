remains in many Places of 11111 City the Sign of the Maiden·
head, which no doubt {hould be our Lady's· head. 'Tis to
this we owe the Name of Maiden· Lane, where there was
formerly the lmao ge of the Virgin Mary; and IbeIIeve that
Lad· Lane rs no more than LadysLaue just as Rude· Lane ·
was denominated from a Rude‚ or our Saviour on the Crosa,
which 111 that Place was formerly m very great Esteem‚ aud
much resorted to iu the times 01 Popery‚ not to insist up'on
many other ancient Ceremonies and Customs pradich by
the old fleathens, ⁵aud smce taken up by the Monks and
Fryers. To reciie and reckon up 111 these would be too te·
dious, and would extend this dlfcourse beyond what Ι 11 first
proposed· and 111111101011111111111111011 my 111111 present to
deplore the Loss of that 10 much desired Description of this
our ancient City, by that incomparable Antiquary, Mr. John
Leiand‚ who being aNativethereof, was educated ata SchooI
credied by the Pious and Learned Deon CoII et, and after·
wards travell'd 11110 Italy, where Learning 11 that tIme was
iua flourIIhing State. After he had made 1 considerable Pro·
gress thereIn he returned home, and by the Favour of Henry
VIII. he had a Commiffion granted to him to vifit the Li·
11111111 in 111 the Monasteries throughout Englaod, which at
that time were well stored with excellent Book s of 111 Sorte.
By this means he had 111 opportunity 01 gleaniug every thing
that reiated to the Antiquities 01 this KIngdom, aud particu-
larly what concerned London, as may be farther observed
from his New· Year’ s Gift to HenryII VIII
His Remaius have been ever smee a Standard to all that
have any way treated of the Antiquities 01 Ε113111111.1 R. Wolfe
intended to have made use 01 them, altho’ this was not done
’1111 after his Death by Harrison, HoIIIngihead, and others
⁴ concerned 111 that Work. HarriIon transerIbed his ItInerary‚
giving a DescriptIou 01 England by the Rivers‚ buthe did not
understand it. They have likewise been made use 01 by se·
veral 11111111, as byjohn Baie, Michael Drayton Will. Burton,
eamden, Pettys, and Fuller in his Lives of our Famous Men.
But how much more compleat had this been, had 11 been
finiihed by hImIelf? 111111οἸ do not 11 111 doubt buthe liv‘d '
