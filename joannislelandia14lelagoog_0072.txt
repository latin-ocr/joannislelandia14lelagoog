Ml. Baunonb’s Lnrrna neunt-rur,

This Discovery was made in the presence of the foresaid
ΜΓ. Cohyers, and Ι remember that formerly many such Bones

· were lhewn forGiants-Bones, particularly one in the Churcb

of Aldermanbury which was hung in a Chain' ona Pillar of
the Church; and such another was kept in St. Laurence’s
Church‚ much of the same Biguess. All which bones were
publickly to be seen before the dreadful lire of London, as
it appears to me from the Chronicles of Stow, Grafton, Mun·
day, dcc.

Ι do not doubt but many Bones of the like nature, as also
the ShankS, ¹Scalps‚ Grinders, &e were formerly preserved y
in such MonasterIes as stood near to the places where they l
were first digged up, and that after some time they were
lhewn to the Common People for the Relicks ofGiants, such
as those of St. Christopher, dcc. ·

At the other End of -the old Roman way, which 1 men· l

’ · tioned at 'first to lead from the 'sowennear the Thames ’

was another Castle, which the Romans built as a Watch· ,
Tower,and is mentioned, if lmillake not, hy Fitz·Stephen, ’
and stood at the Entrance of Black-Fryers into that patrol ς
the 'City This Tower when demolilhed was sufficient to ¹
provide Materials for building a noble and magnificent House
for the Fryers, who met with such signal Favours and Eu·
contagement‚ that part of the very Wall of the City (which
run in adiredi Line from Ludgate to the Thames) was re· ’
moved for them,· that part which then came to this Calile
being pulled down 'to make way lor their Settlement, and
turned lhort to Pleet ditch, as appears by the Ruius at this t

⁸ time. · l

Some Years agoe on the Southhde‘of Ludgate was taken
up out of the Rubbilh a Roman Inscription, that harh 'been ,
taken notice of by some learned Men, and not many Years
srnce on tbe‘left Hand coming in at Ludgate, in the Rest-
dentiary’s Yard of Saiut Paul's was discovered a Roman
Aquaeduit close adjoyning to the Wall of this City. Such y

· another was found after theFire hy Mr. Span an ancient Ci· ’

tizen, in Holyday·Yard in Creed Lane, in digging the Foun·
dations for a new Building, and' this was carried round a Bath
that was built ina round Forme with Nitches at an equal 3

distance for Seats.
Ar some small Distance further on the left Hand, at the

West End of St. Paul’s oter against St. Paul's College in a
vacant place, was dllcorered a Potter’s Kiln, where were made r
several Vellels of Clay oi a red Colour curioully glaz’d, which l
were of different Shapes and Sizes‚ as oceahon lhould re·
quire them to be made use ol iu their Sacrihtes, and many y
times
