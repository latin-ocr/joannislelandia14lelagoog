Roman Magistrates were discovered by the Falli Capitolini,

’ HR? .

a Monument as valuable sor the Latin as the Parian Chroni· ,

cle is sor the Greek History. But sor my own part Ι defigo
to mention only some sew os the Customs lhave been spent,
ing os, (well knowing that 1 am not by any means adequare
‘to the subject) and those too chiefly such as have fallen
within my own Observation.
Ι Frrst then Ihave osten thought, and am now sully per·
swaded, that the Plauting os Vines ιιι the adjacent Parte
about this City, was first of all began by the Romans, an in·
duslrious People, and famous sor their slrill' ιιι Agriculture
'and GardenIng‚ as may appear srom the rei agraria scriptores

as well as from Pliny, and other Authors We hadalhues

yard ιιι East· Smithfield‚ ariother' ιιι Hatron Garden, (which
at this time is call’d VineStreet) and a third in Suint Giles's
in the Fields. Many Places in rhe' Country bear the name os
the Vineyard to this day, especially Ιιι the ancient Monasle·
ries, as Canterbury, Ely‚ Abbington‚ dcc. which were lest as
such by the Romans. And tho' some may objest that several

Places which bear this name are certainly osa later date ’

than the Roman times, yet 1 desire them to confidet that
what Ι have here advanced is not to be understood of them
either as Cities or Towns os dislindlion but ouly as they
were Places where the Romans, during their Refidence here,
exercised themselves in Hulbandry‚ and were willing that
they should semein to Posterity as Tokens os their Skill and
Diligence in Affairs os thIs Nature.

To this' give me leave to add οιιι Prize· fighting, which

Ι can ascribe to nothing else buc the same sort os Exercise ,

prastised by the Roman Gladiatora Nay, our Bull and
Βω- -beating are the Remarns o sthe same People as are οιιι·

May· ·Games, Mumming, Murrice· dancing, stc. which hap- .

pened much about the same tune os the Year, as they do
now amongst us. ·

Master os the Ruff· Game' rs an Office slill ιιι being, and rs
nothing but the same that was Ιιι hrgh esleem arnongst the
Romans. As to the Brothel- Houses formerly ιιι Southwarlt,
we find a Statute as old as the Reign os Edw. ΙΙΙ. sor their
Toleration‚ (aud Ι have seen Statores ιιι that behall amongst
your own Colledlions, being transcribd by you from the

very Book formerly made use os by stow) and' tis probable ’

that they were first established by the Romans, (sor the ΒιιΙΙ

and Benr Garden ιιι that Place rs but os lateSettlement ‚) who .

had also a Play· ·H0use on that side, and had their Abode
yppypyluch ιιι Southwark, ,which was thenas llace os Forti
