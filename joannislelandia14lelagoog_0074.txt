Mr. Baesonu's Larasa anuarino

particularly that' ιι was built on the South- fide of St. Paul'a
Fot' tt seems to me, that thole large quantities of Velfels that
haye been found on the Well sade, were the remaining Prag-
ments of such as were broken at the Ki ln when lirll made.
And it· fartlaer Search had been made eon the Soutlr· sade, and
nearer Dostors Commons, there might probably hare been
found many other RomanAntiquities, which would bave
given several curious, learned and judicious Men much greater
light into these Matters than ’tis pothhle for them now ιο ob·
tain without the help of such Affi'llance.

Herel must take notice of a MS. left by Mr. John Co·
uyets, whetein he gives au alecount of the Portery found ou
the tuest-fide of St. Pauls, which is now ln the Hands of the
ingenious and learned Dr. Hans Sinone, and will afford abun·
dariae of ufeful Diverfion to such as are liodious in thefe lue
quiries, there being many excellent Observations conched in ·
it, every way worthy the Charafler of the curious and iuge·
nious Anthor. Βιιι Ι take the liberty of recommending this
Book particularly for this reason, because we were much iu
the dat-k before these Antiquities were found out in digging
the Foundations of Churches and Houfes sance the Flre. For
what had formerly been done by Leland (rvhich no doubt
was perform’ d with great Accuracy ol Judg ment, being col·

Ι 1εᾶιά by him from the most approved Authors, whereiu he

had talc n infinite Pains) seems now to be quite lost, tho' ι
it must be own’d that many Aarthors that have written bf the 1
Antiquities of England sance his' time, have made frequent

ἱ uef of his Works he alone laying the Foundation of what

hath sance been dilcover’d For l do notin the least question,
but that moll of hist Writings (a terh s Death) first came into
