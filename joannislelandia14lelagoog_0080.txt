the Tower, built of Stone and some Layersof Roman Βιὶειιι
waso of lale withina few Years destroyed and pulled down
to make way sor new Housea by Mt. Mount a Stationer,
who liveth near the same. This Wall ran direcily through
part ol the Towery so that one part thereos was in Middle·
sex, and the other within the Liberty of the City. We need
not doubt that William the Conquerou'r built about this an·
cient Site‘ of tlte Romans, on purpose to keep the City in
awe, and' ιι harh since been greatly increased by the Kiugs

olEngland‚ being formerly accounted one of the strongest
Castles ιιι the Kipgdom.

As sor the ancient Gates of the City, there were but three
at first next the Laud : ι. Algae, or Oldgate, leading into
the East Parte, as Effert, Suffolk, Nerion, &e a. Aldersgate‚

= leading 1nt0 the North Parts. 3 Ledgate‚ now, Ludgate‚

(that ssoryof King Lud ts fillitious, lam afraid) leading to
the Western Roads os this Kiugdom.

The Roman Military· way, as Ι before observed came di· ·
reslly stom the Tower rua straight Line to Ludgate, and so
turned up by the Gate ..... through a passage formerly
called Bower· Rota, intoa Street now called Gill pur Street,'
aud afterwards through that place call’d the erderness sor·
merly belonging to the Carthuhans, direslly pointing and
leadiug' into Old Street, and so t0,01dFord, andsrom thence

· away to Waltham- Stow or Stone.

'lhe two other Gate- -ways led direttly to the old Militaty-
way, which we now call Old-Street, being the most ancient
Street remaining about Londou. ThatHigh·way which leads
from Aldersgate to lilington has been made sometime sance the
conquest, and, lbelieve, much about the same time that the
Ground was taken in fot building the Carthusran Monastety

. (now called the Chanar-Haase) by Sir Walter de Maney.

Not that this Society uvas alone made happy by so prudent χ
a Choice. F or many of our ancient Kings and Nobility took l
dclight in the Sitnation os the old Roman Buildiugs, which ι
were always very line and pleasant, the Romans being very ¹
