’ ευττετιοε,’ viz. that whilst C. Alledius, Captain of the Roman

Heli, tvas thus bufied in his Pagan Sacrifice, M. Aur. As-
clepiodotus, D. of Cornwall‚ whom the Britains had elected
to be their Chief, came to London‚ beheged¹ and entred it.
,Between whom was a mighty Conflia, ’till at last Asclepio-

η dotus vanquilht the Romans, and remain'd iu the City. After

thisbe belet Gallus, and other Roman Captains, and over·
came them: So that the Romans being put 'to the Sword,
their chief Captain Gallus was cast into a Btook, which
from thence was called Gallbrook, and since Wall-hrook,
(for at that time of dayI think there was no Wall to the
City) that tunneth near London Stone, which is alioman .
Mile-stone, standing near the Midway between Ludgate
and the Tower Postern-Gate.

What other Temples either the ancient Britains or Romane
had within the limits of this City2 have not yet fallen within
my Observation; ahho' Ι am apt to believe that they both
worlhipped the hinne Gods, under different denominatione,
and very near accorded in the manner oi their sacrifices:
and 'tis very probable that Belinsgate is derived from Belin,
the Britilh Name for Apollo, and not from' a King‚ as several
have asserted. l will not be positive, hut 'tis likely many
other Temples‚⁴ besides what are here mentioned, were eredi-
ed in this City‚ ol which Time may perhaps make a more
ample Discovery.

The next Remmk I lhall make is that, (as Mt. Selden
hath ohserv'd in his Notes upon Drayton's Polyolbion p. 126 )
London is deriv'd from· Luna, another Name for Diana,
and worlhippedin her Temple. Both She and her Brother
Apollo under the Name of Belin werp two great Deities
amongst the Britains, as wellas Romans. =
2 And now l shall take notice of a very great Curiostty found

. in Mam-Lana, more properly called ‘biart-Lane, it being a

Place where the Romans, aad not improbably the ancient
Britains used to hartel· their Commodities, as Tin, Lead, Bac.
with other Nations‚ it may be with the Greeks, who often
orme into this Illand to purchase the like Goods. Whence
«Ι am apt to eonjeiiure that the Name of the Lane hath been
continued ever· since the Times of the Romans, and that the
Names of some other Lanes and Streets, as Cornhill‚ Grate-
Street‚ the Qenne, Broad-Street, watlingstreet, and perhaps

. Old Filii-Street, &e areos equal An'tiquity‚ and were so ·

called from the same kind of Aecidents. The Curiohty 1 1
’ am speaking ol' is a Brick, found about fourty Years since 28.
