¹Imight here mention theold Custom os Skimington, when
aWomao beate her Husband, of which we have no Memory
but in Hudibras, ahho‘ s have been3 told os an old Statute
made for that pnrpos . 3

This¹ brings to my mind another ancient Cust0m‚ that 3
hath been omitted os iateYearS. It seems that in sormer timeo 3
the Ponere that ply'd at Bilinsgate, used civisiy to intrent 3
and desire every Man that passed that tvay to salute a Post J
that stood there in a vacant Psace. Is he refused to do this, 3
they sorthwith lay’d hold os him, and hy main soree bouped
his A—-se against the Post3 bnt is he quietly submitted to kiss 3
the same, and paid down od. then they gave him a Name, ζ
and chose some one os the Gang sor his Godsather. l be· 3
liene this tvae done in memory os some oid image that sor·
merly siood there, perhaps os Besae or Belin. ’

Somewhar os the like Posi, or rather &tumn was near St.

, Pauts, and is at this day cass'd St. Panl's Shimp. - 3

Within the memory' osonr Fathers in Shropthire‚ in those 3

,Villages adjoyning to Waies when a Person died, there was 3

notice given to an old Sire, (sor so they cnls’d him,) who 3
presendy repair'd to the Psace where the deceased say„ and 3
stood besore the Door os the House, when some os the Fa·
mily came out and surnished him with a Cricket, on which Ξ
he sat down saciag the Door. Then thee gare him aGroat,
which he put in his Pochet, aCrnst os Bread which he eat, j
and a sali Bowle os Ale which he drani< off at a dranght. ἵ
After this he got up from the Cricket‚ and pronounced
with a composed Gestnre, ‘The rose ond rest of thr Soul depart-

cd, for colried he would poton his aava Sonl. This I had frona

the ingenious John fiabrey Esq; who made a collection of
curione Observations, which Ι have seen, aad is now remain-

ing in the Hands os Mc. Charchill the Boohselier. How can

a man think otherwise os thie, than that it proceeded from κ
the ancient Heathens? .

Ἰ hare heard os another Custom that is pradised in some
Parts os Lincohnhire, where, on some peculiar Nights, they
make great fires in the publici< Strcets oi their Towns with
h‘ones os Oxen, Sheep, Sec. which are heaped together sor
some time before, I am apt to believe this Custom was con'·
tinued in memotyos burning their Dead, and that from
hence came the original of Bonefires. Which reminds
meos what is mentioned in the Office os the 'Dead in ont
Litnrgy, where these words, (stom the ‘ancient Custom os
