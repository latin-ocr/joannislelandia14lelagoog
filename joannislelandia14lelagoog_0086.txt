nxxtnt Mt. Broronn’s Lnarea renarint:

not a Foundation of Learning‚ and being not endued with
much Judgment, it was impoffrble for him either to write in
so critical and accurate atnanner astmight be exspefted from
a profeffed Scholar, or to know fo well what was proper to
be taken into a Work that treated of Antiquities.

And now l ihail take notice of our M. Drayton, who by
the Encouragement of Sir Walter Arion, ander. John wit· Ἴ
liams the Qteenb Goidfmidr, who procured him Leland’s
Itinetary, has given with great Accuracy of Judgment in
Blank Verfe, A Description of England by the Riycrs in each
County engrated in Copper. The first part is illustrated with
Mt. Seldcn'a Notos, and at the beginning of the second
(altho' not printed ’nil forne Yeats after) is a Satyr upon the
Bookfeliets. This ia the only Country that hath been thus
described, h. e. by the Rivers engrav’d.

Ι halt next obferve the various Forrns of Buiiding‚ from
the Honses that are left standing in and about the adjacent ’
Parts of this City, some of which are worthy ont Observa-
tion‚ and by often viewing may be near assigned to the Age .
in which they were built. The most t antique are thofe that
terrain of the Diffolv’d Monasteries. Most 'of thern ate built

with Timber, as forne few in Grent St. Bartholomew's near
Smithfield. But the oldest 1 have seen is now standing at the

strongly built with Timber, witha Turret at one Corner,
which I take to be very ancient. There ate others in Al·
detfgate·Street‚ Red·Crofs street, and many other Streets in
and about the City, where the Fire did notreach, as there
are likewife in Batnaby·Stteet in Southwark to fay nothing
of the Post-House in the Burrough. There is also in West·
minster an ancient Chapell vwith the following Inscriptinn cut
in Wood under the Tiiting, ibitiieu Qdip, Quibctssf
obtin, {imp suntin, which tho' anciently a Chapeil dedi-
cated to the Virgin May, is now a Bake Houfe.

'Here we must take notice, that there were no Brick build-
ings in England, except the Chimneys, before the Reign of
HenryVH, and that even such as were afterwards built,
were chiefly in MonasterieS, ot some few Palaces for Kingat
and Noblernen‚ such as that of Onldfotd, (which was Henry
¹the Eighth‘s Houfe) Brook Houfe at Hacknoy‚ (which was,
the Lord Shower'sHonfe‚) another Houfe in the fame Town,
besides the Chutch·House in the enosch-rard, all built in
the farne Fortn with Brick,· a thing which hatlr not been taken i
notice of. Neanstepney ir another House, which is called y
King John's Coun, for what reason I cannot tell, but sure 1 ³

arn that it was n'ot built before the Reign of Hffilssy ξΙΙ,
